# OpenSuSE and Micro OS on Raspberry PI 4

I generally like SuSE and it was actually the first distribution I bought
a license for, I think it was SuSE Workstation 9. I later turned to
Ubuntu and that have been my major Linux distributions since Warty (version 4.10).

I have now been playing around with different distros again, especially on
RasberryPi and wanted to try the Micro OS but I emmediately got into trouble
and this is a way of me documenting what I experience.
